## dasher project dash design principles ## 

importance has a visual heirarchy
level of importance changes with value and with values of other gauges
bright backgrounds are blinding at night ( e.g. aircraft cockpit design doesn't fit cars)
rows and matrices of identical gauges/switches are hard to read - see space shuttle dash!
emulation of 3D is not necessarily a good thing
sliders, bar graphs, round gauges should have bracketing which delineates the full range
it can be good to have both digital and visual output
everything should be themed to accommodate tastes and disabilities ( color blindness etc) also helps immensely with design interation
rear-camera display can be overlaid with gauges, with care
many people cannot read small text - maybe themeing is good here
colors have meaning, but maybe not the same meaning in all cultures?- theme
icons are not generally useful
clutter is bad
values have changing meaning- speedo at 25, at 50 at 95 - at 25 check against city speed limit, low importance. at 65 check against highway speed limit, watch tickets, medium importance. at 95 danger and tickets/jail
values don't change linearly; values meaning changes in thresholds more than linearly - engine temp at 50-180F just fine-ignore, engine temp at 230F-WARNING
idiot lights have a use- they only react when some big thing has changed- time to service- over-heat-charger plugged in
